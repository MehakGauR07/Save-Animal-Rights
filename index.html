  const defaultTemplate = `Honourable Supreme Court of India,

I write to you with utmost respect, but also with deep concern and urgency, regarding the recent verdict directing the removal of stray dogs from Delhi‚Äôs streets and their housing in shelters.

This directive is in clear violation of The Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001, enacted under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. These Rules explicitly mandate that sterilized and vaccinated street dogs must be returned to the exact location from which they were captured. Relocation is expressly prohibited under Rule 7(9), as it disrupts territorial stability, causes unnecessary suffering, and undermines effective population control.

Beyond the legal conflict, this order will have grave and irreversible consequences:

1. Mass Suffering of Dogs ‚Äì Delhi has a high stray dog population, and shelters are already overcrowded and under-resourced. Removing all dogs will inevitably result in severe deprivation of food, water, space, and veterinary care, leading to illness, injury, and death.

2. Violation of Democratic Principles ‚Äì Even the highest judicial authority is bound by the Constitution and laws passed by Parliament. Overriding statutory provisions without legislative amendment sets a dangerous precedent for the rule of law.

3. Undermining International Commitments ‚Äì India is a signatory to international animal welfare guidelines that prohibit indiscriminate culling or displacement. This order contradicts our obligations and harms our global reputation.

4. Economic & logistical impossibility - Sheltering tens of thousands of dogs would require massive land, infrastructure, veterinary care, and food supplies ‚Äî resources that currently do not exist and would cost the public exchequer far more than community-based sterilization programs.

5. Violation of community rights & compassion laws - Many local communities care for and feed neighborhood dogs, forming bonds over years. Forcibly removing these animals breaks these relationships, causes emotional distress, and directly violates citizens‚Äô right to practice compassion under Article 51A(g) of the Indian Constitution.I therefore earnestly request this Honourable Court to reconsider and withdraw this directive in full compliance with the Animal Birth Control Rules, 2001. A lawful, humane, and scientifically sound approach‚Äîfocused on sterilization, vaccination, and community engagement‚Äîremains the only sustainable solution that safeguards both public health and animal welfare.

I place my trust in this Honourable Court to uphold the Constitution, protect the law, and prevent needless cruelty.
